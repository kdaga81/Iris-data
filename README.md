I'm starting my journey in Data Science to explore the latest AI ML technologies. This is the "Hello World" program and I explored
Exploring Dataset
Data Preprocessing
Plotting Data
Training Data
Building different models on this data
Getting 93% accuracy (I hope it's good for a beginner xD)


**Dataset Information**

The dataset consists of 150 instances, with each instance belonging to one of three classes, each representing a different type of iris plant. Specifically, the dataset includes:

- 50 instances of Iris Setosa
- 50 instances of Iris Versicolour
- 50 instances of Iris Virginica

One of these classes (Iris Setosa) is linearly separable from the other two classes. However, the remaining two classes (Iris Versicolour and Iris Virginica) are not linearly separable from each other.

The attributes in the dataset are:
- Sepal length in cm
- Sepal width in cm
- Petal length in cm
- Petal width in cm

Each instance is characterized by these four attributes.
